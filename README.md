hi

this is a pcb of a game where 2 players try to reach a programmed amount more than what 
the other player reached - electronic recreation of Tug of war

I'll upload the code to run on an arduino mega , in that case you will only nead to solder
the leds ,resistors and push buttons 
the other option is to upload it to the micro controller on arduino uno and transfer the chip
to the pcb ,in this case you will also need to solder the crystal and capacitors and a 5v power 
source 

I'll upload all the necessary code and schematics to this repository

any recommendations will be highly welcomed
feel free to use it and do any changes you want
